# Day 17

Starting of today with the change of all distance metrics to use distance to the plane instead of just the camera location. 

First I need to change the polygon closestDistance and average distance, then change the polyhedron methods. 
Woot, everything works. Added a new method overloads for avgDist and closestDist which takes in a plane now. Now, Everything in the scene is sorted by avgDistance to the plane.
