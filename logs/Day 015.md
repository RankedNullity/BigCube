# Day 15
It's the weekend so its going to be a rather short day.

## Progress Log
Major changes to graphics structure to allow for the creation of multiple scenes. 
- Moved all of the parts common to a 3D scene into an abstract class called Scene3D
- Moved all of FPS counters and refresh rates into Scene3D
- Scene3D now houses PaintComponent(Graphics g) override which should be the structure for each scene.
- Scene3D has abstract methods which compose the rendering of the scene, and should be implemented for each scene. These are not implemented in Scene3d as each method should have the potential to be different. 

## Possible Ideas for the future
- Further refactoring by creating an abstract class for third person and first person cameras.


## Goals for next time
- Performance optimizations for cubeScene.
	- Keep a collection of all the cubes which need to be rendered. These would be all the cubes in active animations and all the cubes that are in the 3 most adjacent faces to the camera. This is also true for individual cubes. (6 n^ 3) -> 3 (2n^2 + n(n-1) + (n-1)^2)
		- Upsides:
			- Significantly better speed increase
		- Downsides:
			- Selecting these cubes could take a significant amount of space. 
	- Could also render only a hollow cube, (6n^3 -> 36n^2).
		- Upside:
			- Extremely easy to do
			- Less memory
		- Downisde:
			- Much slower
	- Could also do some combination of the two. Namely always keeping the 3 sides which need to be rendered for every cube. 	Theoretically, this is cheap as this calculation can be performed alongside the averageDistance() calculation and both need 	to be performed at least once. However, these are performed at different times. avgDist() being inside updateDrawables and 	getRenderables being inside render(). However, I can just store a pointer inside the cube3d when calculating avgDist() and 	call that for render.
- Probably sort the polygon list using a better sorting algorithm (currently using heapsort).
	- Heapsort has a few major advantages. The main one is the fact that I am currently keeping the polygons in a linkedList, and heapsort can be done sequentially. (without array positions, otherwise that would be extremely expensive)
	- To write a different algorithm would involve extracting it to an array and sorting it. This would just add n to the operation time. How many items can we expect to see? Well with a cube of 100, thats 6 * 100^3 items. Ok worth it. I guess ill do it. 
- Updating the cube with and without animations each time a move is performed. 
- Attach a solver to the cube and use the solver to automatically solve the cube.
- Write a user interface which allows movement of the cube.
