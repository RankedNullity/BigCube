# Day 15

Short Day. Didn't do terribly much because its a weekend.

- Made a little demo with cubes rotating independently around a center cube. 
- Cleaned the working branch of all previously used libraries (no longer needed, commit history shows actual results)
- Started refactoring CubeScene3D into Scene3D as to make scene creation easier (if needed for the future. Irrelevant for the current project (maybe for visualizing the ML later?))
- Wrote very primitive (but accurate) lighting for engine (with light source originating from camera location).
