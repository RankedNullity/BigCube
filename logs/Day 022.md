# Day 22 
Finally back on this project. EVerything feels weird because I'm no longer in the middle of everything, and I have to go back and load everything into my working memory. 
Man, do I really appreciate the value of documentation now. 

# Today's Agenda: 
- Finish animations 
	-[Fin] Change the insides of the rubicks cube into a passive color. 
	-[Fin] Implement the animation step in megacube
	-[TODO] Implement the control system for animations in rubicksScene.

# Comments
- Finished animation step in megacube.
- Need to add a method which updates the colors on the megacube to match that of a gameCube object. 
- To do this, I need to convert the gameCube index to the megaCube index (These are not identical). The gameCube indices are top left (0,0) to bottom right (n-1, n-1) from the perspective of the face. The megacube index are (0,0,0) at the smallest x,y,z values, and (n-1, n-1, n-1) at the largest x, y, z values (in order). The best way to do this would be to use the CRMatrix which I already wrote, but that would require a lot of rewriting of existing/working code for not much gain. Therefore, I will simply write a method in MegaCube which converts one type of index to another. 

- Finished the updateColors method, now just need to finish the method which converts GameCube indices to MegaCube. Need to do this by hand to figure out what the expected behavior should be. 

- Finished the conversion from gamecube to megacube coordinates. After running the test, I found that the cube was being rendered top-bottom instead of bottom-top so everthing along the y axis was flipped. Bug has been rooted and fixed.
