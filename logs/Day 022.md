# Day 22 
Finally back on this project. EVerything feels weird because I'm no longer in the middle of everything, and I have to go back and load everything into my working memory. 
Man, do I really appreciate the value of documentation now. 

# Today's Agenda: 
- Finish animations 
	- Change the insides of the rubicks cube into a passive color. 
	- Implement the animation step in megacube
	- Implement the control system for animations in rubicksScene.


# Accomplished:
- Finished the implementation of the animation steps in MegaCube. Now I need to handle the full animation steps inside RubicksScene.
