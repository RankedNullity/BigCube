# Cube Formulation

## Minimal One Hot Encoding (MOHE) vs Full Sticker Color Encoding (FSCE)
- [ ] FSCE
	- Easy to graphically display
	- Easy to code
	- Computationally expensive
- [ ] MOHE
	- Harder to code
	- Least expensive
	- Hard to display
	
Will start off using only MOHE. If need be, will implement a MOHE -> FSFE method for use in graphics.
