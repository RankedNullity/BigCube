# Day 3
Finishing Full Sticker cube. Still unsure of # of available positions for higher dimensional cubes, and how to apply a input reduction on the cube in general. 

Starting reading into Group Theory.

Looking up god's number cubes,
- No god's number has been calculated for 4x4 and above.
- Discovered there is a metric for higher dimensional cubes called outer block turn metric (OBTM) and single slice turn metric (SSTM). Everything regarding the number of moves in this project will be using the single slice metric. 

God's number
- 1 - >  1
- 2 -> 
- 3 -> 25
- 4 -> 35< x <53

Estimation using n^2 / log(n). Unsure if this is verified. Will use it in the meantime because it generally estimates n=2,3,4.
