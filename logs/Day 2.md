# Day 2
Got word from Justin that he'll finish the graphics by the end of saturday/sunday. Today, I'll just take a break and do a little bit of mathing to see if I can figure out the group properties of the edges of the rubicks cube in higher dimensions. Plan to start the full-sticker representation on sunday or monday.
