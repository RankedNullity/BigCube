# Day 13

## Completed 
- Finished camera controls and updates (not implementing rotation around view vector)
- Changed drawables to be contained in each Polygon3D object, as now I wont have to make new objects evertime, as the number of vertices for the Polygon2D object should remain the same for each Polygon3D object. 
- 

## TODO
- Write generateCubes
- write UpdateDrawable
- Debug camera placement
- Fix zoom value
- Implement controls for cube and animations. 
- Figure out how to render multiple scenes at the same time with only one scene having camera control. 
- Implement intuitive GUI instead of buttons
