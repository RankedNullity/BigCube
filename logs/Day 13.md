# Day 13

## Completed 
- Finished camera controls and updates (not implementing rotation around view vector)
- Changed drawables to be contained in each Polygon3D object, as now I wont have to make new objects evertime, as the number of vertices for the Polygon2D object should remain the same for each Polygon3D object.
