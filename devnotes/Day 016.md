# Day 16

Spending most of today working on performance updates.

- Refactored Scene3D to have a default updateDrawables and render
- Made a superclass interface for all sceneObjects. That way I can render them in order in the scene.
Problems.

- Avg Distance for the polyhedron doesnt work when getting the drawable faces. ~~Use closest Distance~~
- On further inspection, the closest vertex assumption does not work for figuring which faces to render.
For example when trying this on the rubicks cube, in the starting position, the camera is closest to the bottom left vertices on the cube, but I still need to render the top right. So instead of the distance to the camera, I need to check which direction the view vector is facing. 

After speaking with my friend and colleague Sasha on the subject, I realized that I was using a orthographic projection instead of the usual pinhole camera approach. This explains a lot of things, such as why the cube looks a bit weird when zoomed in too much, and there is noticeable warping on the sides. Also why my approach with using the vertex on the cube closest to the camera location wasn't working. It would normally work for a pinhole camera, but since I am using an orthographic projection, the distance should be the distance to the view plane.
