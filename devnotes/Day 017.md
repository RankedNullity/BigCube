# Day 17

Starting of today with the change of all distance metrics to use distance to the plane instead of just the camera location. 

First I need to change the polygon closestDistance and average distance, then change the polyhedron methods. 
Woot, everything works. Added a new method overloads for avgDist and closestDist which takes in a plane now. Now, Everything in the scene is sorted by avgDistance to the plane. 


Next step:
Optimize the Scene3D cube with the same optimization, namely we only need to render the cubes which are on the 3 faces which can be seen by the camera. This should drastically increase the performance further on the scene by a significant factor
- n^3 ->  n^2 + n(n-1) + (n-1)^2
      ->  3n^2 -3n + 1
