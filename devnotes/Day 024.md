# Day 24
Goal: Fix clipping issue during animations

Idea for fix: Instead of holding all the objects to be rendered in one priority queue, render the layers in an ordered structure. Change visibles to be an array of depth buffers, one for each layer of the cube, separated in parallel to the slice which is being animaated.

## Recap:
- Finished adding the layer behind the animation-active slice, so that the cube doesn't look hollow.
- Still need to add the correct layering tags for each of the non-active pieces.
